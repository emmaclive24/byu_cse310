Here's a complete, detailed, and professional README tailored for your **To-Do List app in C++**, built using **Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition**:

---

# Overview

This project represents my personal effort to deepen my understanding of the C++ language by building a functional console-based To-Do List application. As a software engineering student and aspiring developer, my objective is to gain hands-on experience with core C++ constructs such as file I/O, dynamic memory management, object-oriented programming, and basic data structures.

The To-Do List application allows users to create, manage, edit, and delete tasks from a persistent task list. It demonstrates practical use of C++ standard libraries and encapsulation through custom classes, while applying real-world logic to handle user interactions via a command-line interface.

The primary goal of this software was to reinforce concepts around C++ syntax, memory safety, class structures, and interaction with external files for data storage.

# Development Environment

* **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition
* **Compiler**: Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler
* **Platform**: Windows 10/11 (x64)
* **Language**: C++ (C++17 standard)

### Key Features Used:

* Custom `Task` class with encapsulated data members
* Dynamic memory allocation for task storage
* File input/output for persistent data saving
* Menu-driven command-line interface
* Use of STL containers (`vector`, `string`) and algorithms

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* Implement sorting and task prioritization by due date or urgency
* Add category tags and task filtering
* Improve user interface with color-coded CLI output
* Create a GUI version using a C++ framework like Qt or wxWidgets
* Add time tracking for tasks and deadlines
* Include data validation and exception handling for edge cases
