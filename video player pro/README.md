## Usage
- **Play/Pause**: Click the play button (‚ñ∂/‚ùö‚ùö) or the video itself to toggle playback.
- **Seek**: Click or drag the progress bar to jump to a specific time. Hover over the progress bar to see a time preview.
- **Volume**: Use the volume slider to adjust audio levels or click the mute button (üîä/üîá) to toggle mute.
- **Fullscreen**: Click the fullscreen button (‚õ∂) to enter/exit fullscreen mode.
- **Playback Speed**: Click the settings button (‚öôÔ∏è) to open the menu and select a playback speed.
- **Captions**: Click the captions button (CC) to toggle placeholder captions (extend with WebVTT for actual subtitles).
- **Responsive Behavior**: The player adjusts its layout and control sizes for smaller screens.

## Customization
- **Video Source**: Update the `<source>` tag in the `<video>` element to use your own video file.
- **Styling**: Modify CSS variables in the `:root` section (e.g., `--primary-color`, `--bg-color`) to change the color scheme.
- **Captions**: To add real captions, include a WebVTT file and add a `<track>` element to the `<video>` tag, e.g.:
  ```html
  <track src="captions.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">
  ```
- **Poster Image**: Replace the `poster` attribute in the `<video>` tag with your own image URL for the video thumbnail.
- **Additional Features**: Extend the JavaScript to add features like keyboard shortcuts, quality selection, or custom controls.

## Notes
- **Dependencies**: No external dependencies are required, as all styling and functionality are implemented with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Limitations**:
  - The captions feature is a placeholder and requires a WebVTT file for full functionality.
  - Some browsers may restrict autoplay or fullscreen when not hosted on a server due to security policies.
- **Debugging**: Open the browser's developer tools (F12) to check the console for errors if any functionality doesn't work as expected.
- **Video Source**: a video from BYU class on creating a github repository

## Troubleshooting
- **Controls Not Working**: Ensure the video file is accessible and the browser supports HTML5 video. Check the console for errors.
- **Fullscreen Issues**: Some browsers require the page to be served over HTTP/HTTPS for fullscreen to work.
- **Duration Display Errors**: If the duration shows incorrectly, verify the video file's metadata is valid and the `loadedmetadata` event is firing.
- **Performance**: For large videos, ensure your server supports range requests to enable smooth seeking.
